## Blend Mode Demo

I still find myself surprised by CSS properties I've never seen or heard of before. One such property is `mix-blend-mode`. MDN has some nice [documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mix-blend-mode) on it.

As soon as I discovered this property, I wanted to build something that showcased all possible values for it. You can [play with the demo](http://blendmode.surge.sh/).

### CORS
Most image sharing sites don't enable [cross-origin resource sharing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS), so try to use [Imgur](https://imgur.com/) or another site you know of with lax CORS policies.
